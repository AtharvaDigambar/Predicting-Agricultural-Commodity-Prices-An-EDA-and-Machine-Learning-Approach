# Agricultural Commodity Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds a **machine learning model** to predict the `Modal Price` (most frequent price) of agricultural commodities in India based on market data. The analysis covers price variability across states, districts, and commodities, while the model leverages a Random Forest Regressor to provide accurate predictions.

**Objective**: Empower farmers, traders, and policymakers with data-driven price forecasts.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Dependencies**: Install required Python libraries (see Tools & Technologies)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository** (if hosted on GitHub):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agri-price-prediction.git
   cd agri-price-prediction
   ```
   Alternatively, download the project files manually.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Save your dataset as `market_prices.csv` in the project root directory (or update the file path in the script).
   - See "Datasets Used" for details on preparing the CSV.

## Datasets Used

### Source
- **Data Origin**: The dataset is derived from agricultural market price records provided in a comma-separated format.
- **Time Period**: July 27, 2023 - August 2, 2023 (expandable with additional data).
- **Scope**: Covers multiple states in India (e.g., Gujarat, Bihar, Haryana, Kerala).

### Structure
The dataset is stored in a CSV file (`market_prices.csv`) with the following columns:
- **State**: State in India (e.g., Gujarat, Bihar).
- **District**: District within the state (e.g., Amreli, Madhubani).
- **Market**: Specific market within the district (e.g., Damnagar, Jainagar).
- **Commodity**: Type of commodity (e.g., Bhindi, Apple, Tomato).
- **Variety**: Subtype of the commodity (e.g., Bhindi, Local).
- **Grade**: Quality grade (mostly FAQ - Fair Average Quality).
- **Arrival_Date**: Date of arrival at the market (format: DD-MM-YYYY).
- **Min Price**: Minimum price in INR.
- **Max Price**: Maximum price in INR.
- **Modal Price**: Most frequent price in INR (target variable).

### Preparation
1. **Create the CSV**:
   - Copy the dataset from your source (e.g., `<DOCUMENT>` content) into a text editor.
   - Save as `market_prices.csv` with commas separating values and headers as the first row.
   - Example content:
     ```
     State,District,Market,Commodity,Variety,Grade,Arrival_Date,Min Price,Max Price,Modal Price
     Gujarat,Amreli,Damnagar,Bhindi(Ladies Finger),Bhindi,FAQ,27-07-2023,4100,4500,4350
     Gujarat,Amreli,Damnagar,Brinjal,Other,FAQ,27-07-2023,2200,3000,2450
     ...
     ```
2. **Place in Project**: Store `market_prices.csv` in the project root or update the scriptâ€™s file path.

### Notes
- **Size**: The sample provided has ~10 rows; the full dataset may contain hundreds.
- **Outliers**: Contains extreme values (e.g., 59,000 INR for Bitter Gourd in Bihar), addressed in preprocessing.

## Tools & Technologies Implemented

### Programming Language
- **Python**: Version 3.8+ for data analysis and modeling.

### Libraries
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and loading CSV files.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib**: Basic plotting for visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Enhanced statistical visualizations (e.g., boxplots, heatmaps).
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning tools including `RandomForestRegressor`, `LabelEncoder`, and evaluation metrics.

### Development Environment
- **IDE**: Compatible with Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm, or any Python editor.
- **Version Control**: Git (optional, if hosted on GitHub).

### Model
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Chosen for its ability to handle categorical data and non-linear relationships.

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Setup
- Ensure Python and dependencies are installed.
- Confirm `market_prices.csv` is in the project directory or update the path in the script.

### Step 2: Run the Script
1. **Save the Code**:
   - Copy the Python script (below) into a file named `price_prediction.py` in your project directory.
   - Update the `df = pd.read_csv()` line with your CSV file path (e.g., `'market_prices.csv'` if in the root).

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean
